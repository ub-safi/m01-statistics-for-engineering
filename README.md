# M01 "Statistics for Engineering"

Learn how to use the methods for efficient engineering data collection and to support statistical analysis and modelling based on numerical and categorical data in Python. This course is suitable for engineers with responsibilities in new product design, development and manufacturing. It is also for current product quality management, who wish to develop advanced knowledge and skills: the application of statistical methods and tools to underpin model-based problem solving, data-driven product, and process design decision-making.



## Prerequisites

- technical English suitable for regular professional use
- no significant previous coding experience is required but some experience would be beneficial
- attendance of "Introduction to Python with Google Colab" module ([`M00`][1]) would be advantageous
    - for delegates not attending `M00` and not familiar with the Colab environment, attendance of the pre-course tutorial session is expected
